# GronthoMongol

GrothoMongol is a charity project by Pashe Achi Initiative. The purpose of the project was to support the booksellers of Nilkhet, the country's busiest bookmarket, in the lockdown period due to COVID-19. GronthoMongol was an experimental Android Application for easier management and handling of the books. Users could find available books and order them directly from the app along with other features. The app provides both admin and user mode in the same platform.
'Backendless' is used as the cloud database for the application.

This app has been discontinued.
